Hi there, this is website landing page which would serve as A place to showcase my works. I had been learning software development for the past 3 years and Recently I decided to actually do my  learning and building public . Backend stuffs are very crucial and fun, Backend languages helps us solve a lot of problems , but Unfortunately... Non technical people may not fully realize how great they are. So, I've planned to get deep into Development rather than standalone Programming. These are like a bundle of tools which can help you make Products , and I'm planning Create a lot of "Cool" web-apps This contains About, Skills, projects, contact me sections with an amazing Visual appearance based off aroura theme by Dominik serafin. For now , the Contact me form just has 3 social media informations given... In the future I might actually create a form . I am also planning to create a blog section in the future. And there will be lots of better and fun projects on my portfolio. So Stay tuned my friends!
