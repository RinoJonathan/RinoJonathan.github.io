Hi  this is website landing page which would serve as A place to showcase my works. Its currently just a static site  So that I could host it in github for the time being.  I had been learning  Programming  for the past 3 years and Recently I decided to actually do my  learning and building public . Backend stuffs are very crucial and fun, Backend languages helps us solve a lot of problems , but They alone can't help us create a full fledged product. So, I planned to get deep into Development rather than standalone Programming, and I'm planning Create a lot of "Cool" web-apps . This contains About, Skills, projects, contact me sections with an amazing Visual appearance based off aroura theme by Dominik serafin. For now , the Contact me form just has 3 social media informations given... In the future I might actually create a form . There will be lots of better and fun projects on my portfolio. So Stay tuned my friends!
